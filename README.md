## Gameplay

Angular_Uno follows the same rules as the classic card game "Uno". The objective of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards.

Players take turns playing cards that match the color or number of the card on the top of the discard pile. If a player can't play a card, they must draw a card from the deck. The game includes special cards such as Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, and Wild cards, which add an element of strategy and unpredictability to the game.

The game ends when one player has no cards left in their hand. That player is declared the winner, and the game is over.
